How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

Since the bug is introduced by new changes, it is ok to just check the diff 
between two versions.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

It keeps track all the changes and makes things easier for troubleshooting and 
compare difference.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google 
Docs does?

manual commit is more flexible, but sometimes may forgot, auto commit is easy, 
but maynot logical.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is for coding, and multiple files are closely related. However, for google 
doc, each doc maynot closely related.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to find the versions to compare, use git diff to do the compare.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

It is easy to get back to the previous state.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Try some real staff.
